# Meal Recipe Finder 

This webpage, made with React and libraries such as Chakra UI, Axios, React Icons, and React Hook Form, will help you find interesting recipes by category or name.

## Demo

## With this project, I practiced

- **Creating custom hooks:** to fetch categories and meals from the API.
- **useEffect:** to render the categories and meals, and also to reset the search form when a category is selected.
- **useForm:** to manage the search functionality.
- **Axios:** to make HTTP requests to the API.
- **Chakra UI:** using components like Grid, Card, Modal, OrderedList, VStack, etc.
- **Skeletons:** using SkeletonText from Chakra UI while data is loading.
